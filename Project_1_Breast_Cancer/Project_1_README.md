# Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

## By: Srisatya Pusuluri

## Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook contains data science exercises pertaining to the Breast Cancer Data set. The goal is to find trends and gather insights about the data through exploratory data analysis and Python. It guides users through the notebook and highlights important discoveries.

## Key Findings
The analysis covers various aspects of the Breast Cancer Data set, uncovering key insights:

1. **Patient Age Statistics:** Explore the distribution and summary statistics of patient ages in the dataset.

2. **Time Differences between Surgery and Last Visits:** Analyze the time intervals between surgery and the last visits to understand patient follow-up patterns.

3. **Gender Distribution:** Examine the distribution of gender among the patients.

4. **Histology Counts:** Investigate the frequency of different histology types in the dataset.

5. **Protein Expression Levels and Correlation:** Explore protein expression levels and analyze correlations between different proteins.

6. **Association between Surgery Type and Tumour Stage:** Investigate the relationship between surgery type and tumour stage.

7. **Survival Rates:** Analyze survival rates among patients.

8. **Average Ages Grouped by ER Status and Tumour Stage:** Explore average ages based on ER status and tumour stage.
