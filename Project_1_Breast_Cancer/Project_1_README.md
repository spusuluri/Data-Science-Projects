# Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

By: Srisatya Pusuluri


## Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook contains data science exercises pertaining to the Breast Cancer Data set. The goal is to find trends and gather insights about the data through exploratory data analysis and python. It guides users through the notebook and highlights important discoveries.

Key findings include patient age statistics, time differences between surgery and last visits, gender distribution, histology counts, protein expression levels, and their correlation. The notebook also investigates the association between surgery type and tumour stage, survival rates, and average ages grouped by ER status and tumour stage. This were found using different functions in the pandas
package such as `groupby`, and `pivottable` and other functions. 

## Python Packages Used

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib.pyplot`
* `pandas`
* `seaborn`
