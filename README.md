### Tools Used

- **Python:**
  - Libraries: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, seaborn, scipy.stats
  - Applications: Jupyter Notebooks

- **SQL:**
  - Database: MySQL
  - Queries: UPDATE, Aggregation, JOIN, CASE, DISTINCT, UNION, GROUP BY, HAVING, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, WINDOW FUNCTIONS

## Projects

### Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

**Purpose:**
Explore the Breast Cancer Data set to uncover insights into patient demographics, treatment patterns, and survival rates.

**Key Findings:**
- Patient age statistics
- Time differences between surgery and last visits
- Gender distribution
- Histology counts
- Protein expression levels and correlation
- Association between surgery type and tumor stage
- Survival rates
- Average ages grouped by ER status and tumor stage

**Conclusion:**
Comprehensive exploration of Breast Cancer Data set using Python packages.

### FIFA Player Analysis Project

**By:** Srisatya Pusuluri

**Purpose:**
Thorough analysis of FIFA player data, exploring player characteristics, team dynamics, and attribute relationships.

**Data Overview:**
- Examination, cleaning, and transformation
- Visualizations: bar graphs, correlation plots, histograms, box plots
- Statistical tests: ANOVA, t-tests, correlations, linear regression, KMeans clustering

**Tools Used:**
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Numpy, Scikit-learn

**Conclusion:**
Insights into FIFA player data through examination, cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical tests.

### Yeast Transcriptomics SQL Analysis

**By:** Srisatya Pusuluri

**Purpose:**
Analyze gene expression data in MySQL database, exploring patterns, biological processes, and categorizing genes based on expression levels.

**Table Definitions:**
- `sc_expression`: Gene expression data with condition columns.
- `new_conditions_annotation`: Annotation table with primary and secondary conditions.
- `labels_MF`, `labels_BP`, `labels_CC`: Tables for gene functions, localizations, and validations.

**Functions Used:**
SELECT, UPDATE, Aggregation, JOIN, CASE, DISTINCT, UNION, GROUP BY, HAVING, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, Window Functions

**Conclusion:**
Comprehensive understanding of gene expression dataset, answering specific questions related to gene characteristics and experimental conditions. Explore SQL file for detailed code.
